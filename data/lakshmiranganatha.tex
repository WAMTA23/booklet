The Flexible Computational Science Infrastructure (FleCSI) is a compile-time configurable framework for multi-physics applications development. FleCSI provides an abstraction layer to control different runtime interfaces, e.g., Legion, MPI and HPX for distributed-memory execution, and Kokkos and Kitsune for shared-memory execution. This presentation discusses the results of some scalability studies of iterative solvers developed on FleCSI comparing the Legion and MPI backends. We will share some of the challenges we encountered in completing this work.
