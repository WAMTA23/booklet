HPX is a fully Asynchronous Many Task (AMT) runtime system extending the C++ programming language. HPX provides lightweight user-level tasks that run on top of kernel threads. In this poster we add configurations that tweak HPXâ€™s parallel algorithms and observer how performance is affected by that. Since different types of base algorithms (scan based, iterative, bulk etc) are exposed through the standard parallel algorithms we experiment with selectivity of cache and chunk size in order to achieve an optimal set of parameters for a given set of algorithms. Although this poster concentrates on a particular sample of an iterative based algorithm (adjacent\_difference) the results can be extended (deduced) accordingly within this set. The performance measurements presented in this poster deliver useful information to the global community on how to organize the execution of these sets of algorithms in order to align the different execution characteristics (architecture, granularity, chunking etc) in favor of performance
