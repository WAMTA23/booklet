Partitioned Global Address Space (PGAS) programming models, languages, and libraries offer HPC software developers a set of abstractions that facilitate parallel communication and computation, including remote memory access and remote procedure calls. This talk will give a high-level overview of PGAS research and development at Berkeley Lab, covering our contributions to the PGAS software ecosystem, including our work on unit tests for the PGAS features in the LLVM Flang Fortran compiler; creating the Caffeine coarray Fortran parallel runtime library [1]; producing the UPC++ PGAS template library [2]; and developing the GASNet-EX exascale networking middleware that supports a range of PGAS languages, libraries, and frameworks [3]. The talk will also highlight the use of the aforementioned technologies in task-scheduling frameworks, including FEATS [4], Legion [5], and DepSpawn [6].
