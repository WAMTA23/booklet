In this presentation, we propose the first steps of validating a phase-field model for nearly
incompressible solids. To avoid locking effects therein, we propose a mixed form for the solid
displacement equation as formulated in [1]. For the numerical solution, we adopt a fully-coupled
approach, which is implemented in DOpElib [2] and currently extended with adaptive mesh
refinement and parallelization using the deal. II-github-phase-field framework [3]. To validate
this new phase-field model for rubber-like materials, we compare - in collaboration with the
Deutsches Institut für Kautschuktechnologie e. V., Hannover, Germany, - experimental data of
crack propagation in Carbon Black filled EPDM rubber against our numerical simulations and
figure out differences, difficulties and challenges.\\
