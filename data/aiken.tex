This talk will summarize experiences over the last several years in writing task-based libraries for deep learning, tensor algebra, and solving sparse linear systems, among others. Because many performance-related decisions in task-based programs are late-bound, meaning they are left abstract in the program itself and only fixed when the program is run, it is possible to change these decisions easily, enabling rapid iteration after a code is written to find the combination of decisions that work best for a particular execution environment. This ability to productively modify performance-related decisions and the ability to easily change the partitioning of data have turned out to be key to achieving state-of-the-art and highly portable performance.
