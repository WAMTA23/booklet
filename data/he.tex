The C++ standard defines many algorithms. Usually, a new C++ standard is updated every three years. HPX library needs to follow the C++ code standardization to support sequential and parallel implementation for all algorithms. But some of the HPX algorithms didnâ€™t adapt to the latest C++20 standard. I adapted rotate algorithms using the tag\_invoke CPO mechanism to add the correct overloads for the algorithms as mentioned by the C++20 standard. Moreover, further optimize the adapted rotate according to the characteristics of rotate implementation by implementing core partition functionality, which enables left and right elements to be processed to obtain the corresponding proportion of a number of cores as needed.
Then compare the speedup of rotate algorithm under different policies (parallel, sequential) and optimized rotate. More specifically, creating a benchmark for rotate algorithm and testing its performance changes when tweaking different parameters (like input size and the number of threads, chunk size).
The performance of parallel rotate is much better than that of sequential rotate. And also, the core partition functionality worked, and rotate performance improved by about 15\%.
