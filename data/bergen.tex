FleCSI is a task-based runtime abstraction layer that provides a single-source programming model for shared and distributed-memory parallelism. FleCSI also provides several user-configurable data structures that can be combined to create custom interfaces for multi-physics application development. This talk will provide an overview of recent improvements and new capabilities, including a new tracing interface, support for arbitrary color-to-process mappings, and support for upcoming accelerated system architectures.
