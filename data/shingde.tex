Asynchronous task-based systems offer the possibility of modeling better use of large-scale heterogeneous architectures. One such example is the Uintah framework. At this time hedgehog library of NIST presents excellent single-node performance and low overhead using the data flow graphs approach. This paper combines the two methods and evaluates their performance on multi-node GPU architecture using matrix-matrix multiplication. The algorithm builds on the hedgehogs' previous single-node implementation based on the outer product approach and expands it to multi-node architectures using MPI. To evaluate this approach, we compared the performance results against the SLATE and DPLASMA software which implement generic matrix multiplication in similar environments.
