When we design parallel programming systems (languages, libraries and abstractions in general), we are faced with a multitude of use-cases, some arising from applications and some arising from community micro-benchmark suites. Initially, the focus of a developer is to support a narrow set of these. As the utility of the system broadens and additional applications come in to its ambit, the system needs to add new features and generalize existing features. Such additions tend to have a detrimental impact on performance. This challenge is especially acute for asynchronous task-based systems for a variety of reasons. This talk will deal with challenges of dealing with this tradeoff and potential solution strategies for it. It will build upon our experience with the Charm++ software stack, which also includes associated abstractions including Adaptive MPI.
