Qthreads is a parallel programming library based on user-level threading. It offers a rich API for thread management and synchronization. The API enables expression of producer-consumer relationships and of parallel patterns. Locality-aware optimizations are available through a set of task schedulers with optional work stealing. Qthreads is used in several downstream projects, including HPEâ€™s runtime system for Chapel, and serves as a platform for pioneering novel programming model features, resource-aware scheduling techniques, and interoperability. In this talk, we give an introduction to Qthreads and explain relevant concepts and design choices of the interface and implementation. Further, we discuss a representative use case. Finally, we provide an overview of the current research areas and conclude the talk with an invitation to engage with the community.
