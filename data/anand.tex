I will present a gradient-damage theory for fracture of “quasi-brittle” materials under tensiledominated stress states.  The theory is developed using the method of virtual-power.  The macro-and microforce balances, obtained from the virtual power approach, together with a standardfree-energy imbalance equation under isothermal conditions, when supplemented with a set ofthermodynamically-consistent  constitutive  equations  provide  the  governing  equations  for  thetheory.  The general theory has been specialized to formulate a model for fracture of concrete --- a quasi-brittle material of vast importance.  We have numerically implemented our theoryin a finite element program, and we present results from representative numerical calculationswhich show the ability of our simulation capability to reproduce the macroscopic load-deflectioncharacteristics as well as crack-paths during failure of concrete in several technically relevantgeometries reported in the literature.\\
