Kokkos is at its core a data parallel C++ Programming Model designed for Performance Portability.
Originally developed at Sandia National Laboratories, it is now maintained by an open-source development team spanning multiple US National Laboratories.
Today, Kokkos is commonly used in high performance computing applications and libraries in conjunction with MPI.
This mix of MPI and Kokkos establishes a clear separation of concerns: Kokkos is used to expose fine grained data parallelism,
which can be mapped portably to all common HPC hardware architectures,
while MPI deals with coarse grained parallelism - in particular at an inter-node level.
This talk will discuss how Kokkos could - and likely should - play the same role for asynchronous many-task models.
To that end the presentation will review the high-level design of Kokkos integration into Legion, HPX, and Uintah, and point out opportunities of leveraging capabilities in the larger Kokkos EcoSystem such as portable tools and math library support.
