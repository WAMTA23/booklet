SYCL is the Khronos heterogeneous programming language that is selected for multiple DOE Exascale programming model including Aurora, Perlmutter, and Frontier.

By focusing on open ISO languages such as C++ with the addition of heterogeneous offloads to support the newest accelerator hardware, this talk aims to showcase how SYCL can also become an open standard for HPC and AI. In that respect, Kokkos, and HPX have both been built on top of SYCL.

Technology trends require software/hardware co-design for HPC and AI systems. Open-standard software programming models such as Khronos SYCL and oneAPI enables this co-design and allows us to support initiatives such for parallelism and acceleration for Exascale computing. In future, we plan to support RISC-VÂ® processors as accelerators for HPC and Datacenter and Cloud Computing.
