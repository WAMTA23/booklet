The Uintah Computational Framework is being prepared to make portable use of current and emerging exascale systems, initially the DOE Aurora system through the Aurora Early Science Program. While Uintah's tasks have been ported to Kokkos for performance portability, Uintah's task scheduling infrastructure is not yet wholly portable. This paper describes the evolution of Uintah's task scheduling approach to be ready for such architectures. As a part of this, Uintah's Unified Scheduler, which uses raw CUDA, has been ported to HIP and SYCL to help better understand what abstractions are needed to develop a wholly portable task scheduler. This paper extends recent work by exploring performance portability on AMD and Intel GPUs. Results are shown for a benchmark executing workloads representative of typical Uintah application across ALCF and OLCF systems. The latest state of Uintahâ€™s support for Kokkos and challenges relating to preparing single-source code for AMD-, Intel-, and NVIDIA-based GPUs are also discussed
